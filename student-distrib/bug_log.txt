Bug Name: File contents cannot be printed
Bug Description: "When testing read_file, contents of the file cannot be printed out successfully."
Reporter: Shirley
Solution: "Because for executable files, there are many non-characters, printing the whole buf using printf cannot print out the whole buf. Also, if there is no null terminator at the end of the buf, printing the whole buf using printf would cause some errors. To print out the whole executable file, we can print the buf character by character and trace how many characters printed simultaneously. When the number of printed characters reach the total number of chars, just return."
